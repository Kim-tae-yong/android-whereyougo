### Introduction ###

[WhereYouGo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.whereyougo)  is based on [OpenWIG](http://code.google.com/p/openwig/) library

### Source code ###

Please follow the instructions on the [Source Checkout page](http://code.google.com/p/android-whereyougo/source/checkout) to download the source code of the project to your computer.

Same with OpenWIG code [here](http://code.google.com/p/openwig/source/checkout)

Both sources are required to successfully compile WhereYouGo

### Development environment ###

**suggested software**
  * [Android SDK tools](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

  * [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)
  * [Eclipse ADT](http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html)

### Contribution ###

This step is currently on discussion. I personally will not be currently much involved in WhereYouGo developing, but I'll gladly help with testing and publishing on Google Play.
