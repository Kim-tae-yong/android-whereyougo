#### 7. 4. 2012 ####
- [WhereYouGo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.whereyougo) released as OpenSource project

_reasons:_
  * low priority
  * low amount of free time

_changes:_
  * [WhereYouGo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=menion.android.whereyougo) now contain "only" core part of application (GPS and sensors handling), custom design, very nice GPS screen and Compass screen. Also translation to 19 languages remain of course in code!
  * removed mapping part shared with Locus (suggestion is to use [Google API](http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-mapview.html) or [MapsForge](http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/) library)
  * removed rest of main shared code and some "know how" items

#### 15. 9. 2011 ####
